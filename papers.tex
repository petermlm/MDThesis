\subsection{\texttt{IND\_007} - Data Mining Algorithms to Classify Students}

Paper is \cite{ind_007}.

This paper presents the results of a few experiments made to Moodle data. It
also presents a data mining tool for Moodle called Moodle Data Mining Tool.
Finally, the papers shows some results on the accuracy of some algorithms.

The first section, after the introduction, talks about the background of data
mining in \gls{lms}. It goes on describing a few different tasks and citing
other works in the area. The second section describes the Moodle Data Mining
Tool. The third section presents a few experiments and their results. The
experiments intend on evaluating the performance of some algorithms. The
algorithms are executed with data from 7 courses of the Moodle of Cordoba
University.

This papers is very useful for it gives a few resources on data mining in
\gls{lms}. The resources state different techniques and models used in Moodle
Data, and from here it is possible to explore similar works.

The experiments are not very detailed. A few points are made on resampling, for
the data has a clear imbalance. Then the accuracy of some algorithms executed
with the University's data is shown. It is visible that the accuracy of every
algorithm is not better then 65\%, which is very strange.

A lot of data mining methods and algorithms are listed. The experiments don't
really go into detail, and the Moodle Data Mining Tool doesn't play a big role
in the experiments or in the conclusion. Nevertheless, it is a great paper that
points to useful resources.
