This is the repository of my Master's Degree Thesis. Made during the months of
January of March of 2017.

A link for a compiled Thesis Text is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Ih41EumBXCRmNra3h6bE9IeTA/view?usp=sharing).

This repository contains the following:

Note that the data used in this project isn't in this repository because it
cannot be shared.
